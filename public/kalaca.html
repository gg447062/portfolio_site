          this is a game built using javascript and the phaser3.js game engine.
          the idea for this game came about after a discussion with a friend
          about how the protagonists of video games tend to be conventionally
          'good' and the enemies conventionally 'bad'. we decided it would be
          interesting to make a game where the roles are reversed. here the
          protagonist is a diabolical skull and the enemies are angels. my role
          was design and development as well as creating the sprites. the music
          and sfx were made by my friend sam.
