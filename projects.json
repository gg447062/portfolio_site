      "description": "This is a game built using javascript and the phaser3.js game engine. The idea for this game came about after a discussion with a friend about how the protagonists of video games tend to be conventionally 'good' and the enemies conventionally 'bad'. We decided it would be interesting to make a game where the roles are reversed. Here the protagonist is a diabolical skull and the enemies are angels. My role was design and development as well as creating the sprites. The music and sfx were made by my friend Sam.",
